<h1>Have you seen this mysterious bear recently???</h1>
<p> Since the early 2000s, this bear has been known to spontaneously appear in various music studios, obliterate the microphone, and leave.
    Following the release of the legendary album "Graduation," this bear has made few public appearances, but many claim that the alter ego 
    of this bear is none other than reknown musical artist, Kanye West. Any information regarding the wearabout of this bear would be much 
    appreciated as many have fallen victim to his sweet hip hop beats and rhymes.
